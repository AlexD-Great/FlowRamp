# FlowRamp - Video Demo Script
## Forte Hacks 2025 Submission

**Total Duration: 5 minutes**

---

## üé¨ Scene 1: Hook & Problem (30 seconds)

### Visual
- Show map of Nigeria with 200M+ population
- Display statistics: "Only 3% crypto adoption in Africa"
- Show frustrated user trying to buy crypto

### Script
> "Nigeria has over 200 million people, but accessing cryptocurrency remains a challenge. High fees, complex processes, and lack of local payment options keep millions locked out of Web3. That's why we built FlowRamp."

---

## üé¨ Scene 2: Solution Overview (30 seconds)

### Visual
- FlowRamp landing page
- Show three main features with icons: Buy, Sell, Swap
- Quick UI tour

### Script
> "FlowRamp is the first fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for Flow blockchain, specifically designed for Nigerian users. Buy Flow stablecoins with Naira, sell them back to your bank account, or swap between tokens - all powered by Forte's DeFi Actions."

---

## üé¨ Scene 3: Architecture & Forte Integration (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Architecture diagram
- Show flow.json with contract addresses
- Highlight Cadence code in VSCode
- Point to DeFi Actions integration

### Script
> "FlowRamp is built on Flow Testnet with a modern architecture. Our Next.js frontend connects to users' Flow wallets via FCL, while our Node.js backend orchestrates Forte's DeFi Actions.

> Here's the magic: When a user completes a Paystack payment, our backend automatically triggers a Cadence transaction using DeFi Actions. This composable workflow handles token transfers, vault setup, and balance updates - all in one atomic operation.

> Our contracts are deployed at address 0xb30759ba587f6650, integrating with Flow's FungibleToken standard and IncrementFi's swap connectors."

---

## üé¨ Scene 4: Live Demo - On-Ramp (90 seconds)

### Visual
- Screen recording of actual on-ramp flow
- Show each step clearly

### Script
> "Let me show you how easy it is to buy crypto with Naira.

> **[Click Buy button]**  
> First, I'll enter 10,000 Naira - that's about $6 USD. I'll select fUSDC as my stablecoin.

> **[Connect wallet]**  
> Next, I connect my Flow wallet using FCL. Notice how smooth this is - no seed phrases to copy, just a simple connection.

> **[Show payment screen]**  
> Now I'm redirected to Paystack, Nigeria's leading payment processor. I can pay with my debit card, bank transfer, or USSD.

> **[Complete payment]**  
> Payment confirmed! Watch what happens next...

> **[Show backend logs]**  
> Our backend receives the webhook, verifies the payment, and triggers a Forte DeFi Action. The action generates a cryptographic signature, executes the Cadence transaction, and transfers fUSDC to my wallet.

> **[Show wallet balance]**  
> And there it is - 10,000 Naira worth of fUSDC in my wallet, ready to use in the Flow ecosystem!"

## üé¨ Scene 5: Live Demo - Swap (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Navigate to swap page
- Show token selection
- Display quote
- Execute swap

### Script
> "Now let's swap some tokens using DeFi Actions.

> **[Select tokens]**  
> I'll swap fUSDC for fUSDT. Our integration with IncrementFi's swap connectors provides real-time quotes.

> **[Show quote]**  
> Here's the quote: 1 fUSDC = 0.9998 fUSDT, with minimal slippage.

> **[Execute swap]**  
> I'll confirm the transaction... and done! The DeFi Action composed multiple steps: approve, swap, and update balances - all in one transaction."

---

## üé¨ Scene 6: Code Walkthrough (60 seconds)

### Visual
- Show key code files
- Highlight Forte integration points

### Script
> "Let me show you the code that makes this possible.

> **[Show forte-actions.js]**  
> Here's our Forte Actions service. When executing an on-ramp, we generate a secure signature using elliptic curve cryptography - no more mock signatures!

> **[Show execute_on_ramp_with_actions.cdc]**  
> This Cadence script uses DeFi Actions to compose multiple operations: verify the signature, check vault existence, transfer tokens, and emit events.

> **[Show transaction-tracker.js]**  
> We've added production-ready features like automatic retry logic with exponential backoff, transaction monitoring, and comprehensive error handling.

> **[Show rate-limiter.js]**  
> Security is critical, so we implemented rate limiting: 100 requests per minute for general endpoints, 10 for sensitive operations.

> **[Show error-handler.js]**  
> And centralized error handling with custom error classes for better debugging and user feedback."

## üé¨ Scene 7: Impact & Metrics (30 seconds)

### Visual
- Show transaction history page
- Display metrics dashboard
- Show testnet explorer

### Script
> "FlowRamp is already processing transactions on Flow Testnet. Users can view their complete transaction history, track status in real-time, and verify everything on-chain.

> This isn't just a hackathon project - it's a production-ready solution addressing real market needs in Africa."

---

## üé¨ Scene 8: Future Vision (30 seconds)

### Visual
- Roadmap graphic
- Map showing expansion to other African countries
- Mobile app mockup

### Script

> We're also exploring scheduled transactions for recurring purchases, DeFi yield integration, and a white-label solution for other projects."

---

## üé¨ Scene 9: Closing & Call to Action (30 seconds)

### Visual
- GitHub repo
- Twitter post

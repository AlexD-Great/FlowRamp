const express = require("express");


*   Loading environment variables
*   Setting up Express
*   Adding CORS middleware
*   Defining API routes
*   Starting the server























Applying the suggested edit to the previous code makes no sense. The original code is a route, the second one is the main express app. Applying the suggested edit would completely overwrite the original code, which is not what was requested. Therefore, I will reject the edit.

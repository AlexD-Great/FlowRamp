## üí° Key AI-Assisted Features

### 1. Forte Actions Integration
**AI Help**: ChatGPT explained DeFi Actions architecture
**Result**: Implemented composable on-ramp workflows

**Prompt Used**:
> "Explain how Flow Forte DeFi Actions work and how to integrate them into a fiat on-ramp service"

### 2. Cryptographic Signatures
**AI Help**: Copilot suggested elliptic curve implementation
**Result**: Replaced mock signatures with real crypto

**Code Generated**:
```javascript
const messagePayload = `${beneficiary}:${amountUSD}:${sessionId}:${Date.now()}`;
const messageHash = hash(messagePayload);
const backendSig = sign(process.env.FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY, messageHash.toString('hex'));
```

### 3. Error Handling Architecture
**AI Help**: Claude designed centralized error handling
**Result**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints

**Prompt Used**:
> "Design a production-ready error handling system for an Express.js API with custom error classes"

### 4. Rate Limiting
**AI Help**: ChatGPT suggested in-memory rate limiter
**Result**: Protection against API abuse

**Code Generated**:
```javascript
class RateLimiter {
  constructor(windowMs = 60000, maxRequests = 100) {
    this.windowMs = windowMs;
    this.maxRequests = maxRequests;
    this.requests = new Map();
  }
  // ... implementation
}
```

### 5. Transaction Retry Logic
**AI Help**: Copilot suggested exponential backoff
**Result**: Reliable transaction processing

**Code Generated**:
```javascript
async executeWithRetry(txFunction, txData) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= this.maxRetries; attempt++) {
    // ... retry logic with exponential backoff
  }
}
```
